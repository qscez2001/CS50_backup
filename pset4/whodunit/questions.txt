1. What’s stdint.h?

The <stdint.h> header shall declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and shall define corresponding sets of macros.
It shall also define macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.


2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

The typedef name int N _t designates a signed integer type with width N, no padding bits, and a two's-complement representation.
The typedef name uint N _t designates an unsigned integer type with width N.

Thus, uint8_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
Thus, uint32_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 32 bits.
Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
Thus, uint16_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 16 bits.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

typedef uint8_t  BYTE; equal to 1 bytes or 8 bits.
typedef uint32_t DWORD;  equal to 4 bytes or 32 bits.
typedef int32_t  LONG;  equal to 4 bytes or 32 bits.
typedef uint16_t WORD;  equal to 2 bytes or 16 bits.

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

255 216

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

bfSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
biSize: The number of bytes required by the structure

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

If biHeight is negative, indicating a top-down DIB, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS.
Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

24:there's no infile exist.
32:be unable to be written to

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

stdio.h 中的 fread() 將檔案的內容寫進陣列或結構中，共需四個參數，第一個參數為陣列或結構的指標
，第二個參數為陣列或結構的大小，第三個參數為陣列的元素數量，如果是結構就等同 1 個陣列元素，第四個參數為指向結構 FILE 的指標。
Because it specifies how many elements you want to read,
and we're always reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel + 3 padding = 12,

11. What does fseek do?

skip over padding, if any
fseek allows you to change the location of the file pointer.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

int fseek(FILE* fp, long int offset, int from_where);
If you want to change the location of the pointer fp from its current location, set from_where to SEEK_CUR
